# Autonomous Vehicle Simulator Project

Final year project at the University of York. 

Callum Hewitt & Rebecca Milligan worked on two separate projects, based on the same expanded Autonomous Intersection Management codebase from the [Learning Agents Research Group at the University of Texas at Austin](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~aim/).

- Callum worked on an autonomous lane merging simulator. You can read the full report [here](https://github.com/CallumHewitt/AVLaneMergingReport/blob/master/fullReport.pdf).
- Rebecca worked on a car park management system for autonomous vehicles.
